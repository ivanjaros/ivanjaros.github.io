          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            Throughout my entire life, movies, TV shows and cinema altogether, were the best escapism, I could have ever imagined, to spend my free time on.
            I have always had a vivid imagination. I even remember creating a game, during my elementary school years,
            where I have designed multiple levels on a piece of paper and took my schoolmates on a journey where they
            had to solve puzzles, fight creatures and escape traps, by simple movement of a pen on the paper.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unfortunately I grew up in a place that lacked in solid film-making environment and so I didn't see a path
            that could lead me into the career of movie-making and by my sheer curiosity I have ended up with a career of a programmer instead.
            I spent almost all of my free time working on personal projects, mostly one major one that took a decade of my life,
            only to come to a conclusion that the goals I have set initially will never be fulfilled to my satisfaction and vision due to the fast pace of the technology and services today. And so I was finally freed
            from this period of my life, that I am finally ready to leave behind, and follow my childhood dreams of working on films.
            Though I do not regret this period whatsoever. I have become a master problem-solver and that is a great skill to have, especially when it comes to
            the production aspect of shooting videos.
          </p>
          <p>
            Due to the way the industry works, I have decided to follow the path of making commercials. It's like making thousands of tiny shorts and I love the creative part of coming up with great ideas
            and transforming these intangible nuggets of gold into something real in front of the camera. Most of the time I have trouble stopping myself and choosing the final idea because my creative mind just keeps on coming up with new ideas and improvements over and over again.
            I also write scripts and am in the process of looking for a production company to partner up with in order to produce a series I came up with.

          <h2>Services</h2>
          <p>
            The main service I provide is creativity and direction. Based on the requirements, I will create an idea for your product or service and translate it into video.
            I am a master problem-solver so I can also take care of any issues you are facing in the creative part of pre-existing works. This of course means that we must be creatively on the same page from the get-go.
          </p>
          <p>
            My style is unique and differs from most commercial directors, as it should be for everyone. I will never shoot the product or the service directly as the main character, with smiley and happy faces all around it.
            I do not believe in forcing the subject onto the audience. Instead, I am a firm believer that the audience is smart and wants to consume content that feels more natural, smart and witty.
            Hence, I will always create a story, symbolism, metaphor or emotion around the product, or service, and make it a part of the the tale we will unveil for the audience. The product, or service,
            might even become the butt of a joke and the client has to be OK with that in order for me to use my creativity freely, without much restrictions, and produce great content for the audience.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am a strong proponent of contrasts and juxtaposition as well as "show don't tell" mantra, mostly via reaction shots. A simple smile or a look says more than a line of dialogue.
            And that makes the situation much stronger for me than long-winded slogans and lists of attributes and properties of whatever is being promoted. If the product is good, people will buy it.
            If it isn't, no amount of trickery will force the consumer into buying it more than once.
