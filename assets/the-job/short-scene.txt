EXT. CAR INTERIOR

  Tom
Are you sure we got the right guy?

  Maurice
For fucks sake. Can you stop asking the same stupid question?
Mick said to grab the doctor. Did you see any other fucking white coat out there?
No? So shut the fuck up. Will you?!

  Tom
Yeah, you're right.
I just...I just have this feeling we got the wrong guy.

  Maurice
Mother fucker!
Allright then. What do you want me to do about your "feeling"?
Do you want me to drive back and check ther IDs or somethin'?
Nevermind the cops that are already there, taking statements, looking for our car.
Nevermind that there were only 3 other fucking people in the waiting room and that big-titted secretary.
Nah, you are right. Let's just go back and check out...because you have a feeling.
Fuck me.

  Tom
Can we at least stop the car and check the guy out before we deliver him?
I mean, yeah, you're right. Not much else we can do now but I would really hate to
drop the wrong guy at Mick's. You know how he is. I really, really, don't want to fuck up.
Remember what happened Donnie?

  Maurice
No, what happened to Donnie?

  Tom
You know he's missing a finger, right?

  Maurcie
No, what? Why? For fucks sake get on with it already.

  Tom
Mike sent him for a sandwitch and a coffee run for the boys one time. The traffick was shit.
Poor Donnie got back so late the coffee went cold. Mike got so pissed that he slammed Donnies finger with the fucking door.
Came off clean like at the butcher's. And that was just a fucking coffe mate. This ain't just that.
Sure, Donnie never brought a cold one ever again but I don't want to be learnin' the hard way either.

  Maurice
Fuck, allright. You have a point there. Let's make a short stop and check the guy out.
But put the mask back on, I don't want to be identified if this fucker ain't the one we were supposed to get.

  Tom
Right on.

EXT. BEHIND A CAR

  Maurice
Get ready, this cunt is strong as fuck for a doctor. I don't know if the belt will hold him.
Get the knuckles on, just in case.

  Tom
Ready, go ahead.

  Doctor
mmmmmm....(incoherent sound with tied up mouth)

  tied up and gagged doctor, in the trunk, kicks maurice in the face.
  Tom punches him wih his brass knuckles.
  doctor moans in pain.

  Maurice
Fuck. That cunt kicked me right in the teeth. Fuck. Cunt. Mother fucker.

  Maurice punches the doctor in the liver and ties his legs with a rope that got loose.

  Maurice
Weren't you supposed to tie his legs?

  Tom
I did.

  Maurice
Well, obviously you didn't. For fuck sake this is so unprofessional.
When you said you'd deal with it I expected you to do it properly.

  Tom
I swear, I tied him up with that rope. I don't know how he got free.

  Maurice
Lefty loosy, right tidy?

  Tom
Yeah, of course. What else?

  Maurice
You fucking retard. This ain't tieing your shoes. Weren't you in scouts or some shit like that when
you were growing up? Didn't your daddy teach you how to tie a proper knot?!
This is so unprofessional. So unprofessional.

  Tom
Nah, my daddy never was an outdoorsmen. We never went camping.
Though I got lost one time in the woods playing hide and seek. It felt like entire day. But no, it was just half an hour.

  Maurice
For fucks sake, shut the fuck up. No one is interested in your sad life story.
I guess you are the type that has to learn the hard way every single time, right?

  Tom
Forget about it already. I said I'm sorry. Let's check out his wallet and make sure it's the guy.

  looking for wallet, patting the doctor, finding it in his inner pocket.

  Tom
I don't want to be the bearer of bad news but this ain't the guy mate. This is a fucking nurse!

  Maurice
What are you talking about? He has a white coat and the fucking slippers you wear in the hospital.
He was the only white coat in there. You saw it yourself. Who else could we grab? This is the right guy.
Must be.

  Tom
Well, I don't know what to tell you. He ain't a doctor.

  Maurice frees the doctor's mouth so he can speak.

  Maurice
Hey, fuck face. Is you a doctor or not?

  Doctor
No, I am not you fucking cunts. Motherfuckers. Who the fuck you think you are....

  Maurice gaggs him again.

  Tom
See. I had a feeling something was wrong when we grabbed him at that office.

  Maurice
Allrigh. Here's the deal. If you are not the doctor, we will have to part ways...if you know what I mean.
So I will ask you one more time, because I don't have time for this crap, are you or aren't you a doctor?

  Maurice removes the gag again.

  Doctor
Sure, yeah. I am a doctor. I was only joking guys. I am the doctor, yes.

  Tom
So how come you said you wasn't and here it says you are a nurse?

  Doctor
That is my old badge. I am a doctor.... at my own practice.... but I do the nursing on the side.... to pay the bills.

  Maurice
How come you have no doctor's badge then?

  Doctor
I, I must have left it at the office... or home. You know, not much use for it at your own practice.

  Tom
I don't know.

  Maurice
What was the name on the practice when we went in? Do you remember?

  Tom
I think it said Dr. Masters.

  Maurice
And what does his ID card says?

  Tom
Prescott.

  Maurice
Well, doctor. How do you explain this?

  Doctor
I share the practice....my, my name is not on the door. Trust me, I am a doctor. Yeah.

  Tom
What do you think?

  Maurice
Well, whether he is or not, he clearly says he is and whether he goes now or after Mick is done with him
is irrelevant. Let's fucking go and get this over with. I'm cold and I want to grab a hot cuppa.

  Maurice gags the doctor again and closes the trunk.

CAR. INTERIOR

  Tom
Maurice?

  Maurcie
Yeah, Tom.

  Tom
I don't want to loose a finger.

  Maurcie
Me neither. Tom. Me neither.
